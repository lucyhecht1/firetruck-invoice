### Installation  
*Note:* You can access the live version of the app [here](https://lucyhecht1.github.io/firetruck-invoice/)!

To run the app on your local machine:

Clone this repository:

```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd firetruck-invoice
```
Install dependencies:

**Set up EmailJS:**  
This app uses [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send the invoice PDF to users without needing a backend. To configure it:

1. [Create an EmailJS account](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/sign-up) if you donâ€™t already have one.
2. Set up an email service and template in the EmailJS dashboard.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```env
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_public_key
```

Youâ€™ll find these values in your EmailJS dashboard.  
**Note:** Your `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore`.

**Start the app**
```bash
npm start
```
